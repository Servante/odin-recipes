        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
           Wrapped in Mallorn leaves, the flat bread is brown on the outside and cream colored on the inside. Tastier than most Middle-Earth cakes and one bite is enough to fill the stomach of a grown man.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 c. honey</li>
            <li>3 kumquats, whole (can substitute orange zest and a bit of juice if desired)</li>
            <li>2 tsp. orange flower or rose water (optional)</li>
            <li>3 oz. chopped almonds or macadamia nuts (fruits of the Mallorn tree)</li>
            <li>¼ c. melted butter</li>
            <li>2 ¼ c. flour (barley flour of you want to be really accurate)</li>
            <li>½ tsp. salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the eggs, butter, honey, kumquats, rose or orange flower water, and nuts in a food processor or blender.</li>
            <li>Blend on high for 2-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add 1 cup of the flour.</li>
            <li>Blend for a minute or two.</li>
            <li>Put mixture into a bowl and add the remaining flour and the salt.</li>
            <li>Whisk or stir until well blended.</li>
            <li>Bake a small amount of dough (about two tablespoons) at a time on a pizzelle or iron about 15 seconds or until lightly brown, for a flat bread like texture. They can also be baked at 350 degrees for about 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Wrap in a leaf and tie with a string!</li>
        </ol>
